## Storage sizes for repositories

The storage sizes of the repositories are listed on the repository size overview. The sizes correspond to the file sizes and not the disk space that is actually occupied. The size of a repository consists of the repository itself, metadata, LFS files and temporary files. The total size of a repository is also listed.

At the top of the overview there is an option to sort the repositories according to their size.

The repository overview initially consists of the totaled sizes of all repositories. The individual repositories are then listed.
